The 11:05 BT tested the beginning of the channel of the bull [[Spike and Channel]] and it was the end of a second leg down (the correction of the first leg was the sideways [[FH2]] and hence an [[H2]] and not an H3. Worrying about the exact wording is trivial. Remember that the point of counting is to find two legs and this move down is two legs. You can call it an [[H3]] but I would call it an [[H2]] with a sideways correction between the two down legs. Since it was an [[EMA]] [[Gap]] bar and a BT and a [[2nd leg]], it was an adequate but not great long. However, the institutions did not feel good enough until the 2nd entry, which came in the form of the [[DB]], and a measured move up [[DB]] [[BF]] at 12:45.
