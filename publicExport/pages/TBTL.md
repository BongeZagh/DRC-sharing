棒 19 后面一棒是一个十字星，但是棒 19 是一个弱信号。当弱信号之后的入场棒也较弱时，最好高潮在盈亏平衡点附近离场。

  + The large bear trend bar before bar 14 was seen at the time as either a breakout that could lead to a measured move down, or an exhaustive sell climax that might lead to a reversal up, lasting about 10 bars and two legs. Since it followed such a steep series of bear bars without a correction, it was likely the end of unsustainable and therefore climactic behavior.

The strong bull reversal bar and entry bar were evidence that the reversal was strong and that the sellers were stepping aside for about ten bars.
